The Swedish social entrepreneur Andreas Sabelhierta - with 25 years of experience working with children and youngsters - is the initiator behind the mobile application PLAYED.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">This concerns more than 100 000 000 people around the world. Most of which are children that we adults are supposed to take responsibility for.</h2>

<h3 id="toc_1">Net and Game Addiction is an enormous global health problem.</h3>

<p>What will be the consequences? Not only for the young people of the world, but also from a societal perspective. One common view is that game addiction only leads to financial problems. That is not the case however. As net and computer games have moved into our homes and the users have become younger, other, less obvious issues arise.</p>

<p>That´s why the Swedish companies Mp5 Management and Computertalk Sweden, in collaboration with therapist Owe Sandberg, expert in game/net addiction, have developed the mobile application &ldquo;Played&rdquo;. The application is the first of it´s kind and offers you in an understandable way information what net/game addiction is all about.  You will also get information what you can do about it, before it´s too late.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">There is probably not a single teenage parent in this world that hasn´t had almost daily conflicts with their children related to this.</h3>

<p>You may not understand the reason of the conflict or how to confront it. You enter a bus and what you see is a crowd staring at their smartphones. In your home everybody is sitting in front of the television or around the kitchen table with their smartphones.  The brain can never rest because of it´s constant overstimulation.  The senses are constantly bombarded by ringtones, text messages, games and communication programs. Computer games are handled in an unhealthy way and children don´t play with each other as much as before.  The tiny amount of time the family spend together is vanishing into nothing. This will have unforeseeable consequences in the future.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Game addiction has shape shifted.</h3>

<p>Net addiction leads to asocial behaviour, decreasing school results and/or negating the amount spent on gaming.  Just like when abusing narcotics, one is using the &ldquo;drug&rdquo; as a reward for different reasons. Today there exist 17 year old kids with osteoporosis as a consequence of spending 15 to 18 hours daily for years in front of the computer. Osteoporosis is just one of the ailments related to net addiction. The increasing amount of patients in the world that is 25 to 30 years of age, visiting psychologists is staggering. All this because being deprived of real childhood memories other than virtual ones.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">The fact that a problem of this magnitude is hidden is really weird.</h3>

<p>Parents all over the world are trying to deal with this problem daily. We have only scratched the surface of this immediate problem that is finally beginning to get recognised. Despite this there is no name for this syndrome yet and only a handful of countries have recognised it as an ailment. The only country in the world that classifies it as a public disease is China. There 10% of the population up to 15 years of age are affected by net addiction. I often wonder what that number would be if including people up to 25 years of age in the world statistics. This will, in my humble opinion, have enormous consequences from a socioeconomic perspective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It´s important to understand what actually happens in the human brain&rdquo;, psychotherapist Owe Sandberg says.
&ldquo;Most computer games of today are programmed and designed to stimulate the brain´s reward centre so that you become addicted just like with drugs and alcohol.  It is of vital important to break this behavioural pattern, be it you or your children. Stay informed and communicate about it. Knowledge is the key to change&rdquo;.</p>
