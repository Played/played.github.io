  	<h1>PLAYED Intervention</h1>
  		

<h2 id="toc_0">What is an intervention?</h2>

<p>Most people have probably heard that one can not help an addict before the bottom is reached - that is a myth, much can be done before then.</p>

<p>With the support of a loving intervention where everyone is involved, from the gamble addict to the family/network (colleagues, friends, family) around, amazing results are reached.</p>

<p>A PLAYEDIntervention (based on ARISE ™ Invitational Intervention) is a democratic confrontation built on honesty; the gamble addict is invited to join the process from the beginning with no surprises, secrecy or coercion. The network equally so. We start from the beginning with absolute respect and love. We guide the gambling person and persons in network to a game free life and comfortable recovery. All are responsible for their own part.
PLAYEDIntervention breaks the cycle of repeated disappointment and failure, but without the guilt and shame that comes with addiction. It provides no opportunity for the gamble addictive manipulating &ldquo;one-on-one&rdquo; in the network as all are gathered.
With PLAYEDIntervention 83% of the gamble addicts agree on joining treatment, with the brilliant results of 61% maintaining freedom of gambling after the first year.</p>

<p>The method is divided into three phases, which are built solely on the based of needs:</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Phase A</h3>

<p>Phase A: PLAYEDIntervention focuses on a professional intervention to get the gamble addict in to treatment with minimal effort by a loving, empathetic and first call and then the first meeting. The relatives (colleagues, family, friends) are mobilized to form an intervention network around the gamble addict to justify the treatment.</p>

<p>Phase A has three levels and the goal is always to stop at the first level that works:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong> &ldquo;First Call&rdquo; - a relative contacts PLAYEDIntervention for a half hour of free telephone consultation. The relative coached then arranges the meeting for the intervention, guided by Camilla Kuylenstierna. 56% of the dependent accept treatment after Level first</li>
<li><strong>Level 2</strong> &ldquo;The more the better&rdquo; is the next level if the gamble addict does not accept treatment during the first meeting; level 1. It’s proven that the more numbers of people in the gambling addict&rsquo;s life that would help to motivate the treatment and focus on getting these is better.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3</strong>, &ldquo;The formal PLAYEDIntervention&rdquo;, carried out if the treatment was not achieved during level 2. Here the severity escalates and consequences are presented to the addicted if the treatment is not implemented. Here usually up 83% of the gambling accept treatment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_2">Phase B</h3>

<p>Phase B: The family supports the gamble addict by taking the responsibility that starts as soon as the gamble addict startes his/her treatment and lasts for about 6 months.
Individual targets are set for all individuals in the network regarding how they can heal, now that the gamble addicted is looked after. There may be different 12-step programs for family, group coaching for remaining colleagues, therapy of the kind that supports healing.
PLAYEDntervention workis with the gamble addicted, therapists and family members to ensure that the treatment is correctly supported as well as relapse prevention. We also monitor grief and other issues that may be the root of the mental pain of the addiction.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Phase C</h3>

<p>Phase C: To live in recovery. PLAYEDIntervention works in cooperation with the relation network and the gamble addict, prevents relaps and make a plan plan for a sustainable gamble free life and ensures everyone is healing and recovered.
We look at the work, lifestyle, social network, family relationships and personal choices facing recovery. Phase B tends to be extremely rewarding for all involving - here we are living a gamble free and responsible life.</p>
