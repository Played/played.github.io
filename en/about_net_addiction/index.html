  	<h1>About Net and Game addiction</h1>
  		<p>One major and growing public health issue in the world today is the way our youth use the internet and computer games in unhealthy ways. That leads to net addiction. The symptoms are exactly the same as with other abusive behaviours, that stimulate the brain’s reward system.</p>

<p>The concerns are justified and a growing number of studies indicate that Internet gaming addiction is associated with various negative symptoms. The psychological consequences include sacrificing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>real-life relationships</li>
<li>other pastime activities</li>
<li>sleep</li>
<li>work</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>socialising</li>
<li>relationships</li>
<li>obsession with gaming</li>
<li>lack of attention</li>
<li>aggression and hostility</li>
<li>stress</li>
<li>dysfunctional coping</li>
<li>decreased academic achievement</li>
<li>problems with verbal memory</li>
<li>sense of low well-being and high loneliness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, psychosomatic symptoms have been found in a number of studies. These included problems with sleeping, seizures  and psychosomatic challenges. This long list indicates that Internet gaming problems must be taken seriously as they can affect the individual negatively in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>There is hardly any teenage parent who does not have or had a conflict with their teenager that doesn’t involve any of the above.  Just as with alcohol or other addictive substances, the parents and children do not understand that it is an abusive behaviour.</p>

<p>As a parent you cannot see it until the problem has become abnormally large. In most countries, this is a non-recognized problem according to the research community and has not yet been categorised as a public health problem or a sickness. That the number of game addicts has increased and have changed shape to children and young people, is something that most people doesn’t understand, and we cannot predict the consequences or costs yet.</p>

<p>Parents cannot seek help from common health care since this is not a recognised “public health problem” and not classified as a disease. Therapy must therefore be self-funded.
The only country in the world, who classed it as a “disease” is China, where the Public Health Ministry of China claims that 10% of the country’s young people under 15 are net addicts or play computer games in a unhealthy way. The number increases dramatically if you count young people up to 25 year. Over 400 treatment centers have opened in China in a short time for this purpose.</p>

<p>In Sweden we have 40 000 with confirmed gaming and net addict problems, plus 150 000 estimated.</p>

<p>How many of their parents can afford private time with CBT therapy?</p>

<p>How many see that there is a problem in their family with inactive, sedentary unsociable children - trying to do something about it but have no knowledge or method to curb the problem?</p>

<p>As a parent, I want to be able to do something the precious time I’m home after work. I´m standing helpless, and realize that this is detrimental to my child. What should I do?</p>

<p>The PLAYED application can help you find out more about this symptom, finding a way to talk at home or with acquaintances.</p>

<p>The sections “ PLAYED Parents” and “PLAYED Adult addict” shows how one can try to think about or how to express themselves in a conversation with their children or other without falling into a rut or trigger a conflict.</p>
