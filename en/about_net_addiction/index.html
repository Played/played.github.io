  	<h1>About Net and Game addiction</h1>
  		<p>One major and growing public health issue in the world today is the way our youth use the internet and computer games in unhealthy ways.  That leads to net addiction. The symptoms are exactly the same as with other abusing behaviour, that stimulates the brain&rsquo;s reward system.</p>

<p>The concerns appear to be grounded as a growing number of studies indicate that Internet gaming addiction is associated with various negative consequences. The psychological consequences include the following:</p>

<p>sacrificing real-life relationships, other pastime activities, sleep, work, education, socialising, and relationships,  obsession with gaming and a lack of real-life relationships, lack of attention, aggression and hostility, stress, dysfunctional coping, worse academic achievement, problems with verbal memory, and low well-being and high loneliness. Moreover, psychosomatic consequences have been found in a number of studies. These included problems with sleeping, seizures  and psychosomatic challenges. This long list indicates that Internet gaming problems must be taken seriously as they can affect the individual negatively in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>There is hardly any parent of teenagers who does not have or had a conflict with their teenager that doesn’t involve any of the above. The parents and children do not understand that it is an abusive behaviour. Just as with alcohol or other addictive substances.</p>

<p>As a parent you cannot see it until the problem has become abnormally large. This is according to the research community, in most countries, a non-recognized problem which has not yet categorised as a public health problem or a sickness. That the number of game addicts has increased and have changed shape to children and young people, is something that most people doesn’t understand, and we cannot predict the consequences or costs around yet.</p>

<p>Parents cannot seek help from common health care as this is not a recognised &ldquo;public health problem&rdquo; and not classified as a disease. Therapy must therefore be self-funded. The only country in the world, who classed it as a &ldquo;disease&rdquo; is China, where the Public Health Ministry of China claims that 10% of the country&rsquo;s young people under 15 are net addicts or play computer games in a unhealthy way. The number increases tremendously if you count young people up to 25 year. Over 400 treatment centers have opened in China in a short time for this purpose.</p>

<p>In Sweden we have 40 000 with confirmed gaming and net addict problems. And 150 000 estimated.</p>

<p>The game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> has 12.7 million subscribers (2012). The game is designed and configured to trigger the brain&rsquo;s reward system and receptors that make people addicted to the game. It also costs money every month. There is a similar free version of the game , LOL <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends">League of Legends</a>, with 32 million active users and 1 billion game hours / month.</p>

<p>There are only two of many online games in the market. Just these two games have thus about 45 million active users.</p>

<p>How many of their parents can afford / private time with CBT therapy?</p>

<p>How many see that there is a problem in his family with inactive, sedentary unsociable children. Trying to do something about it but have no knowledge / methods to curb the problem?</p>

<p>As a parent, I want to be able to do anything the little time I&rsquo;m home after work. I stand the helpless, and see that this is detrimental to my child.
What should I do?</p>

<p>The PLAYED application can help you find out more about this symptom. Find a way to talk at home or with acquaintances.</p>

<p>The sections “ PLAYED Parents” and “PLAYED Adult addict” shows how one can try to think about or how to express themselves in a conversation with their children or other without falling into a rut or trigger a conflict.</p>
