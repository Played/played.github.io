  	<h1>About PLAYED</h1>
  		<p>Doesn’t children or young people play together spontaneously, socialize and meet IRL (in real life) anymore?  Parents see that their children often are inactive and spends much of their waking hours by the computer playing computer games. Or communicates on social media with a handset like a phone or hand-held computer.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it is strange. It has become a kind of a norm. Few parents or children have the time or the right knowledge to see what is actually happening. To help understand what happens around the phenomenon, online gambling and computer game addiction, we created a application that is easy to understand and easy to use for anyone. PLAYED.</p>

<p>Gambling addiction is now more and more recognised symptoms and there are a range of treatments available. <strong>We at PLAYED know how important it is to do something as early as possible. Before it becomes a problem.</strong> When you as a parent do not know what to say or do will often somewhat out of frustration. Not infrequently that it threatens data ban or that you should terminate the internet subscription. Therefore PLAYED application can help you with both <strong>arguments and useful information.</strong></p>

<p>Often, when you know that your children spend too much time by the computer, it leads to great stress and too often conflict. When you as a parent do not know what to say or do, wrong decisions leads to conflicts out of frustration. Not infrequently data ban or that you should terminate the internet subscription if your kid don’t listen or listens to what you want them to do.</p>

<p>PLAYED is a Swedish mobile application whose purpose is to inform and help adults and children understand what Internet and gaming addiction is. PLAYED is the only mobile application of its kind. It can be used between parents and children. Or if you have a loved one that you want to say what problem gambling is all about. One can also use call methods in school classes or other groups.</p>
